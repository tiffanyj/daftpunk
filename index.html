They spent their time together recording demo tracks with other students at the school. They eventually formed a rock band with their friend, Laurent Brancowitz, in 1992. The band, <a>Darlin'<span><iframe id="darlin" width="400" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uExJeLHW4Hs" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen></iframe></span></a>, was named after a song by The Beach Boys of the same name, which they often did covers of during their live shows. The band's first EP received a negative review that called their musical style, <a>daft punky thrash<span><img id="thrash" width="400" src="img/thrash.jpg"/></span></a>. After Darlin' disbanded, Brancowitz joined the band, Phoenix. Guy-Manuel and Thomas started to make electronic music, using drum machines and synthesizers.

The group sampled various songs and themes from the late '70s and early '80s to create music with a strong synthpop sound. They wanted to make an album that would allow fans to reconnect with the discovery phase of childhood, when attitudes were more open-minded. When fans first heard the album in 2001, they were stunned at the change in music style. The album was wildly successful, generating a new era of Daft Punk fans. The famous single, <a>"One More Time"<span><iframe id="one-more" width="600" height="400" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FGBhQbmPwH8" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen></iframe></span></a>, was played all throughout major clubs in the UK.

          <p id="wide">Between September and November in 2004, Daft Punk spent six weeks working on new material.

This album received mixed reviews from fans who thought that the songs seemed overly repetitive and hastily recorded. A few singles, like <a>"Robot Rock"<span><iframe id="robot" width="400" height="300" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sFZjqVnWBhc" frameborder="0" gesture="media" allowfullscreen></iframe></span></a> and <a>"Technologic"<span><iframe id="technologic" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/track/6qIqFdJ8gIXphYO5GkXR1l" width="300" height="330" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></span></a>, still emerged and did very well on the charts. Daft Punk kicked off their Alive 2006/2007 tour with a single U.S. performance at <a>Coachella<span><img id="coachella" src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/C1Xu__HVIAAZgPa.jpg" alt="Coachella Lineup for 2006"/></span></a> to raving fans.

The duo played the headline festival slot at Lollapalooza festival. They finished their full-fledged North American tour in 2007 with the release of another album, <a>"Alive 2007"<span><iframe id="alive" src="https://open.spotify.com/embed/album/7u6zL7kqpgLPISZYXNTgYk" width="300" height="380" frameborder="0" allowtransparency="true"></iframe></span></a>.
